### Running the Exercises

1. **Make scripts executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

2. **Run any exercise:**
   ```bash
   ./q1.sh    # Array sorting exercise
   ./q15.sh   # Quadratic equation solver
   ./q25.sh   # Interactive system menu
   ```

3. **Run all exercises in sequence:**
   ```bash
   for i in {1..32}; do
       echo "Running q$i.sh..."
       ./q$i.sh
   done
   ```
